c4_cp_whi_wave_form_energy	Spectrum_Code__C4_CP_WHI_WAVE_FORM_ENERGY		1&gt;unitless	Presence of Spectrum Code	Wave form energies and natural spectra are acquired onboard simultaneously and then undergo the same time-averaging processing. However, only a selection of natural spectra is transmitted to ground (1/4 or 1/8, chosen by telecommand) while all energies are transmitted. The Spectrum_Code parameter is equal to 1 if the corresponding natural spectrum has been transmitted to ground and 0 otherwise. Natural spectra can be found in the Ci_CP_WHI_NATURAL dataset.		support_data
