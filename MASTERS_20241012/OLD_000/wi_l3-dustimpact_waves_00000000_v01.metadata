Extended_Description (1 entry):
	0 (CDF_CHAR/895): 	"This dataset contains dust impacts identified with the Wind/WAVES Time Domain Sampler (TDS) Fast Receiver, or (TDSF).  The TDSF receiver records two electric field components and four (commandable) sample rates ranging from ~1875--120,000 samples per second (sps) or time durations of ~17--1000 ms.  Each set of two field components for TDSF is called an event and each component is always composed of 2048 samples.  Nearly all events will be measured by the two spin-plane wire dipole antenna, where the X-antenna is ~100 m tip-to-tip and the Y-antenna is ~15 m tip-to-tip [lengths at launch] and in the 120,000 sps mode.  Some events, however, will have Z-antenna results in which case the impact antenna angles are not calculated and defined as fill values.  The output is reported by channel number with the associated antenna identified by the *_ImpactAntenna CDF variable within each file."

The lunar wake and/or near moon environment was defined using the relative distance between SC and moon, M, and relative locations.  The criteria, in the GSE coordinate system, were to satisfy either of the following:  a) (X_sc < (X_m + 1/2 R_m)) AND (|M_y| <= 1) AND (|M_z| <= 1); or b) (|M| <= 2 R_m).  00 - clear of magnetosphere and moon; 01 - within magnetosphere only; 02 - in lunar wake or near moon only; 03 - near/within both magnetosphere and moon."

     VAR_NOTES       (CDF_CHAR/1242): "The angle accounts for the XY-GSE displacement of Wind but assumes Earth remains at exactly 1 AU always.  The error introduced by not including the change of the Earth's radial position throughout its annual orbit is less than ~0.017 degrees.  The error introduced by not including the change of the spacecraft's out-of-ecliptic displacement is less than ~0.0018 degrees.  The spacecraft (SC) spin axis is aligned within ~0.8 degrees of the south ecliptic pole.  This varies annually due to the differences in torque applied to the SC bus by solar radiation.  The angle can be as low as < 0.1 degrees.We define clockwise (CW) angles as being < 0 for CW rotations to remain consistent with Euler angle notation.  We define CW as viewed from the north ecliptic pole looking down upon the XY-GSE plane.  All angles herein vary from 0 to 360 degrees (absolute values), thus a positive counter-clockwise angle corresponds to [(clockwise angle) + 360] > 0.  The impact antenna angle depends upon the closest impact antenna, defined by the CDF variables Ch01___ImpactAntenna and Ch02___ImpactAntenna.  An example image illustrating the various angles within these CDF files can be found in the Malaspina and Wilson, [2016] (doi:10.1002/2016JA023209)"

     VAR_NOTES       (CDF_CHAR/781): "The impact angle uncertainties are mostly controlled by the quadrant or hemisphere in which the dust impact occurred.  This is true for the Ch1ImpAnt_E_S_Angle and Ch2ImpAnt_E_S_Angle.  This is roughly +/- 45 degrees (i.e., quadrant) for all events.  For the other sun angles (i.e., Pos_Ax_SCS_Angle, Pos_Ax_E_S_Angle, and Pos_Ay_E_S_Angle), the uncertainty is controlled by the spin rate of the spacecraft (determined by event duration and angle subtended during an event) multiplied by the TDSF event duration plus the DPU clock latency uncertainty (i.e., ~10.6 ms).  Thus, this uncertainty is currently < 13 degrees (i.e., worst case scenario for fastest spin rate and slowest sampling rate).  In the best case scenario (i.e., most events), the uncertainties drop to ~3 degrees."
