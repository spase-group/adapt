This is the average of the MIGHTI-A and MIGHTI-B sample times, which differ by 5-8 minutes. Where MIGHTI-A or MIGHTI-B samples are missing, data are reported as missing, but gaps in Epoch are interpolated over to adhere to the netCDF4 standard that coordinate variables should have no missing values. The matchup between MIGHTI-A and B happens at slightly different times at different altitudes, a complication which is ignored by this variable. The effect is small (plus or minus 30-60 seconds), but in cases where it is important, it is recommended to use the alternative time variable Epoch_Full, which is two dimensional and captures the variation with altitude.

     VAR_NOTES       (CDF_CHAR/2454): "The zonal (positive eastward) and meridional (positive northward) winds are the primary data product in this file. They are defined on a grid with dimensions of time and altitude, spanning 24 hours and nominally 90-300 km (150-300 km for the red channel). The altitude, time, latitude and longitude corresponding to each point in the grid are given by other variables in this file. It should be noted that while each measurement is ascribed to a particular latitude, longitude, altitude, and time, it is actually an average over many hundreds of kilometers horizontally and 2.5-30 kilometers vertically (depending on the binning). It also assumes stationarity over the 5-8 minutes between the MIGHTI-A and B measurements used for each point. See Harding et al. [2017, doi:10.1007/s11214-017-0359-3] for a more complete discussion of the inversion algorithm. Knowledge of the 'zero wind phase' is needed for any instrument using Doppler shifts to determine winds. The zero wind phase is defined as the measured interference fringe phase that corresponds to the rest wavelength of the emission. For this initial data release, the zero wind phase has been determined by comparing a 60-day average of MIGHTI data to a 60-day average of the empirical Horizontal Wind Model 2014 (HWM14, Drob et al., 2015, doi:10.1002/2014EA000089), which is a fit to decades of previous wind measurements. At each time and location of a MIGHTI measurement, the MIGHTI measurement is simulated by integrating HWM14 along the line of sight, weighted by the observed volume emission rate as determined by the measured fringe amplitude profile. The 60-day-average difference between the measured and simulated phases is taken as the zero wind phase. This is done separately for each sensor (A and B), for each color (red and green), for each mode (day and night), and for each row (i.e., each altitude). This approach to determining the zero wind phase is analogous to the approach taken for the UARS/HRDI instrument (Hays et al., 1992, doi:10.1016/0032-0633(92)90119-9), which assumed that a long-term average of the meridional wind is zero. Although the long-term average altitude profile is constrained to match HWM14 in this initial MIGHTI data release, measured variations in time, latitude, longitude, and from day to day are retained using this approach. A future data release will leverage ICON's unique 'zero wind'  'maneuver' to determine an independent zero wind phase."

					"The "Accuracy" variable quantifies the error introduced by the zero-wind phase estimate. It is strongly correlated across time lags of days to weeks and becomes increasingly decorrelated for time lags longer than 2 precession cycles (96 days). This error is estimated from the discrepancy between various techniques of determining the zero-wind phase. This error source is irrelevant for most users studying perturbations from the mean (e.g., tides, waves), but may be important for studies of zonal mean winds, point comparisons with other data sets, and seasonal/long-term trends thereof. Errors are moderately correlated across small altitude gaps. Errors in day mode and night mode are nearly uncorrelated, implying there could be different offsets for day mode and night mode. This could be important for error propagation of odd-numbered migrating tides (e.g., DW1)."

					"The "Low Signal Effect" error variable quantifies the error introduced by the imperfect correction for the signal-dependent phase shift, which is an effect seen in atmospheric and calibration-lamp fringes where the phase of the fringes is biased at very low signal levels. This is under investigation but could be caused by a charge trapping effect in the CCD. A correction has been implemented based upon the empirical relationship between measured phase and signal level of the calibration lamps for the first ~30 months of the mission. However, especially for cases with low signal levels, this correction is uncertain. The uncertainty in the resulting winds is estimated from the signal level and reported in this variable. It is likely to be correlated across samples nearby in time and space, but the correlation between different channels (red and green), sensors (MIGHTI-A and MIGHTI-B), and operating modes (Day and Night) is not known. Depending on the analysis being used, it could be treated as a systematic error or as a statistical error. Where this uncertainty is large, caution is recommended. For example, for winds in the core science region (90-105 km altitude), the magnitude of the correction is small or zero, but data in the red channel during the night and twilight are subject to a large correction (many tens of m/s) and the uncertainty is correspondingly large. A goal for future releases is to characterize and correct this effect more accurately."

Pre-flight calibrations and on-orbit comparisons with ground-based instruments are used to determine the best possible calibration. The fringe amplitude has a dependence on temperature, which is corrected using the MSIS model. Because the on-orbit calibration is uncertain, and because the MSIS temperature correction is not perfect, caution should be exercised when absolute calibration is required, or when precise comparisons are being made between samples at very different temperatures. Please contact the MIGHTI team before performing any studies that require absolute calibration. The statistical (1-sigma) error for this variable is provided in the variable ICON_..._Relative_VER_Error, though it is expected that systematic calibration errors dominate the total error."

     VAR_NOTES       (CDF_CHAR/2452): "The zonal (positive eastward) and meridional (positive northward) winds are the primary data product in this file. They are defined on a grid with dimensions of time and altitude, spanning 24 hours and nominally 90-300 km (150-300 km for the red channel). The altitude, time, latitude and longitude corresponding to each point in the grid are given by other variables in this file. It should be noted that while each measurement is ascribed to a particular latitude, longitude, altitude, and time, it is actually an average over many hundreds of kilometers horizontally and 2.5-30 kilometers vertically (depending on the binning). It also assumes stationarity over the 5-8 minutes between the MIGHTI-A and B measurements used for each point. See Harding et al. [2017, doi:10.1007/s11214-017-0359-3] for a more complete discussion of the inversion algorithm. Knowledge of the 'zero wind phase' is needed for any instrument using Doppler shifts to determine winds. The zero wind phase is defined as the measured interference fringe phase that corresponds to the rest wavelength of the emission. For this initial data release, the zero wind phase has been determined by comparing a 60-day average of MIGHTI data to a 60-day average of the empirical Horizontal Wind Model 2014 (HWM14, Drob et al., 2015, doi:10.1002/2014EA000089), which is a fit to decades of previous wind measurements. At each time and location of a MIGHTI measurement, the MIGHTI measurement is simulated by integrating HWM14 along the line of sight, weighted by the observed volume emission rate as determined by the measured fringe amplitude profile. The 60-day-average difference between the measured and simulated phases is taken as the zero wind phase. This is done separately for each sensor (A and B), for each color (red and green), for each mode (day and night), and for each row (i.e., each altitude). This approach to determining the zero wind phase is analogous to the approach taken for the UARS/HRDI instrument (Hays et al., 1992, doi:10.1016/0032-0633(92)90119-9), which assumed that a long-term average of the meridional wind is zero. Although the long-term average altitude profile is constrained to match HWM14 in this initial MIGHTI data release, measured variations in time, latitude, longitude, and from day to day are retained using this approach. A future data release will leverage ICON's unique 'zero wind  maneuver' to determine an independent zero wind phase."

					"The "Accuracy" variable quantifies the error introduced by the zero-wind phase estimate. It is strongly correlated across time lags of days to weeks and becomes increasingly decorrelated for time lags longer than 2 precession cycles (96 days). This error is estimated from the discrepancy between various techniques of determining the zero-wind phase. This error source is irrelevant for most users studying perturbations from the mean (e.g., tides, waves), but may be important for studies of zonal mean winds, point comparisons with other data sets, and seasonal/long-term trends thereof. Errors are moderately correlated across small altitude gaps. Errors in day mode and night mode are nearly uncorrelated, implying there could be different offsets for day mode and night mode. This could be important for error propagation of odd-numbered migrating tides (e.g., DW1)."

					"The "Low Signal Effect" error variable quantifies the error introduced by the imperfect correction for the signal-dependent phase shift, which is an effect seen in atmospheric and calibration-lamp fringes where the phase of the fringes is biased at very low signal levels. This is under investigation but could be caused by a charge trapping effect in the CCD. A correction has been implemented based upon the empirical relationship between measured phase and signal level of the calibration lamps for the first ~30 months of the mission. However, especially for cases with low signal levels, this correction is uncertain. The uncertainty in the resulting winds is estimated from the signal level and reported in this variable. It is likely to be correlated across samples nearby in time and space, but the correlation between different channels (red and green), sensors (MIGHTI-A and MIGHTI-B), and operating modes (Day and Night) is not known. Depending on the analysis being used, it could be treated as a systematic error or as a statistical error. Where this uncertainty is large, caution is recommended. For example, for winds in the core science region (90-105 km altitude), the magnitude of the correction is small or zero, but data in the red channel during the night and twilight are subject to a large correction (many tens of m/s) and the uncertainty is correspondingly large. A goal for future releases is to characterize and correct this effect more accurately."
