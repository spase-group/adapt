	0 (CDF_CHAR/951): 	"Pioneer 10 carries a payload of 11 scientific instruments having a mass of 33 kg and using 24 watts of power. The total spacecraft mass is 258 kg and the diameter of the high gain antenna reflector is 2.74 meters. It is powered by four radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) located at the ends of two trusses extending from the body of the spacecraft. A long boom extending from the scientific instrument compartment supports the magnetometer sensor. The spacecraft spin axis is parallel to the axis of the reflector. Several small thrusters using hydrazine are located at the edge of the reflector to make in-flight velocity adjustments,alter the spin rate and to keep the reflector pointed at the earth. The data are transmitted to the earth by an 8 watt S-band transmitter at one of eight data rates (from 16 to 2048 bits per second).  Pioneer 10 made the first flyby of Jupiter. This was on December 4th,1973. 'Pioneer10 COHOweb connection'"
	1 (CDF_CHAR/64): 	"The investigation objectives for the Pioneer 10 cruise data are:"
	2 (CDF_CHAR/315): 	"   1) The study of the intensity of galactic cosmic rays as a function of solar activity and as a function of helio-centric position. Long-range objectives are to determine the position of the modulation boundary of the heliosphere and the intensity of the galactic cosmic rays in the interstellar medium beyond it."
	3 (CDF_CHAR/136): 	"    2) The study of solar energetic particles as a function of heliocentric distance and their propagation in the interplanetary medium."
	4 (CDF_CHAR/177): 	"    3) The study of low energy electron and proton events to understand the interplanetary propagation and acceleration of such particles as a function of heliocentric distance."
	5 (CDF_CHAR/1126): 	"The GTT electronics system consists of two basic sections.  The first is the power converter which regulates and filters the 28 volt, 20kHz spacecraft power supply. The on-off command functions through a solid state switch by removing power from the driving circuitry. Output voltages of +7.75,+5.00,-12.00 and+900 are supplied to the experiment. The 7.75 and 5.00 volt lines are regulated to 1% and the 900 volt lines are regulated with VR tubes. The second section is the signal processor. This is used to condition the data from the seven detectors and consists of a MOS/TTL/transistor hybrid system containing MOS/TTL logic and transistorized discrete component interface circuits. The processor is completely redundant with the exception of the interface circuits. Upon command from the spacecraft, the signal processor can be switched from the main logic system to a standby redundant logic system. The function of the processor is to sequentially accumulate data on a frame basis from the seven detectors. Data are accumulated in a 24 bit register and then  compressed quasi-logarithmically to 12 bits for transmission."
	6 (CDF_CHAR/2652): 	"Seven miniature Geiger-Mueller (GM) tubes are used as basic detectors. Four of these (A,B,C,and G) are EON Corporation end-window type 6213 tubes. The three other tubes (D,E,and F) are EON Corporation type 5107 tubes. The seven tubes were placed in a variety of physical arrangements. Tubes A,C,and B are mounted in a single block. The central tube C is shielded omnidirectionally. Tubes A and B are similarly shielded except for thinner window unidirectional collimators in the +X direction. The individual counting rates of the three tubes are telemetered separately; also, double coincidences AB and triple coincidences ABC with a resolving time of 1 microsecond are formed and telemetered. The second assembly comprises an omnidirectionally shielded triangular array of three 5107 tubes. The rate of D and the triple coincidence rate of the DEF are telemetered The third assembly uses a thin window 6213 (tube G) in a scatter geometry with a 90 degree gold-plated elbow as the entrance aperture. Detector G looks in the +X direction.  The Z-axis of the instrument is parallel to the axis of rotation of the spacecraft.  The +X axis points outward into free space from the rim of the instrument compartment of the spacecraft. The magnetometer and a portion of the magnetometer boom subtend a trivial fraction of the fields of view of the collimators of A,B, and G; otherwise, there is no physical obstruction within the fields of view.  The rotational axis (+Z) of the spacecraft is pointed continuously at the earth within an error of less than one degree and therefore lies approximately in the ecliptic plane. The  spin period and sampling period are asynchronous; thus angular distributions of particle intensities as a function of roll angle in the equatorial plane of the spacecraft are assembled as a software operation by using attitude data supplied by the Ames Research Center. In our analysis the roll angle is measured from the ascending node of the spacecraft's equator on the ecliptic to the +X axis of the instrument at the midtime of the sample. The instrument uses 12 bits in each 192-bit main science frame of the spacecraft's telemetry format. Quasilogarithmic data compression is used to maintain 1% accuracy at all possible counting rates. All outputs are digital. A complete cycle of the GTT data comprises eleven main science frames as follows: sync word,G,A,B,G,AB,ABC,C,D,ABC, and DEF. Counts from each detector channel are accumulated for a period of time in seconds equal to 192/b, where b is the telemetry rate in bits per second for the entire spacecraft (b=16,32,64,128,512,1024,or 2048, as selected by ground command)."
	7 (CDF_CHAR/171): 	"The GTT experiment utilizes two commands. A power ON/OFF command and a function command for Main/Standby processor selection. (Van Allen, Baker, Randall and Sentman, 1974)"
	8 (CDF_CHAR/611): 	"All known errors have been eliminated from the data.  During the cruise phase, it has been determined that a raw count of 129 is in error.  This is the result of the highest order bit being 1 and all of the rest being zero.  In addition all raw counts greater than 200 have been omitted from the data set.  These values are much higher than any valid rates.from the instrument during cruise. There is no significant dead time correction for any rate observed during cruise.  On DOY 86, 1989 the triple coincidence channel DEF on Pioneer 10 started showing no count rate. Detector D seems to be working normally."
	9 (CDF_CHAR/1280): 	"To process the data for this file the data were uncompressed and divided into 15 minute periods starting at 00:00:00.  This 15 minute unit was then summed by detector and the counting rates computed and written into the record.  When the data rate is high enough to get spin distribution, Fourier coefficients were computed and written into the record.  Selected trajectory information was also written into each record.  See the section on formats for record details. To simplify the summing of data at various bit rates and formats, they were normalized to a rate of 2048 bits per second. Because of this the number of samples per interval will vary somewhat even for 100% coverage.  This normalization creates some apparent inconsistency in the number of data samples contained in a predescribed interval.  To help clarify this problem the following tables are given for reference.  There are two tables, the first is for telemetry formats A, B, and C where the accumulation period is 192 bits long, and the second is for telemetry formats A/D and B/D where the accumulation period is 384 bits long. The various telemetry formats used by the spacecraft have no effect on these data, other than the determination of the number of samples accumulated during the 15 minute period."
