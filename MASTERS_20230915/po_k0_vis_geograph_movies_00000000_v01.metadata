Approximate uncompressed value for Image_Counts(i,j) is ExpandedCount(Image_Counts(i,j)+1).  Approximate intensity in kR is Intens_Table(Image_Counts(i,j)+1).The appearance of the actual count value 255 is rare.  When displaying an image,it works best to use the fill value as an overflow (i.e. brightest) value."
