	0 (CDF_CHAR/516): 	"The Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission is designed to study the characteristics and environment of Mercury from orbit. Specifically, the scientific objectives of the mission are to characterize the chemical composition of Mercury's surface, the geologic history, the nature of the magnetic field, the size and state of the core, the volatile inventory at the poles, and the nature of Mercurys exosphere and magnetosphere over a nominal orbital mission of one Earth year."
	1 (CDF_CHAR/2055): 	"MESSENGER launched on 3 August 2004 at 6:15:56 UT (2:15:56 a.m. EDT) on a Delta 7925H (a Delta II Heavy launch vehicle with nine strap-on solid-rocket boosters). The spacecraft was injected into solar orbit 57 minutes later.  The solar panels were then deployed and the spacecraft began sending data on its status. One year after launch, on 2 August 2005, MESSENGER flew by Earth at an altitude of 2347 km. On 12 December 2005 at 11:30 UT, MESSENGER fired its large thruster for 524 seconds, changing the spacecraft velocity by 316 m/s and putting it on course for its 24 October 2006 Venus flyby at an altitude of 2990 km. The second Venus flyby took place on 5 June 2007 at 23:08 UT (7:08 p.m. EDT) at an altitude of approximately 337 km. The first of three Mercury flybys, all at roughly 200 km altitude, occurred on 14 January 2008 at 19:04:39 UT, and the second on 6 October 2008 at 08:40:22 UT.  The third will be on 29 September 2009. There are also five deep space manuevers. Data collected during the Mercury flybys will be used to help plan the scientific campaign during the orbital phase. Mercury orbit insertion will take place on 18 March 2011, requiring a delta-V of 0.867 km/s. The nominal orbit is planned to have a periapsis of 200 km at 60 degrees N latitude, an apoapsis of 15,193 km, a period of 12 hours and an inclination of 80 degrees. The periapsis will slowly rise due to solar perturbations to over 400 km at the end of 88 days (one Mercury year) at which point it will be readjusted to a 200 km, 12 hour orbit via a two burn sequence. Data will be collected from orbit for one Earth year, the nominal end of the primary mission will be in March 2012.  Global stereo image coverage at 250 m/pixel resolution is expected. The mission should also yield global composition maps, a 3-D model of Mercury's magnetosphere, topographic profiles of the northern hemisphere, gravity field to degree and order 16, altitude profiles of elemental species, and a characterization of the volatiles in permanently shadowed craters at the poles."
	2 (CDF_CHAR/869): 	"The MESSENGER spacecraft is a squat box (1.27 m x 1.42 m x 1.85 m) with a semi-cylindrical thermal shade (roughly 2.5 meters tall and 2 meters wide) for protection from the Sun and two solar panel wings extending radially about 6 meters from tip to tip.  A 3.6 m magnetometer boom also extends from the craft. The total mass of the spacecraft is 1093 kg, 607.8 kg of this is propellant and helium. The structure is primarily graphite-cyanate-ester (GrCE) composite and consists of two vertical panels which support two large fuel tanks and two vertical panels which support the oxidizer tank and plumbing panel. The four vertical panels make up the center column and are bolted at their aft ends to an aluminum adapter. A single top deck panel mounts the LVA (large velocity adjust) thruster, small thrusters, helium and auxiliary fuel tanks, star trackers and battery."
	3 (CDF_CHAR/773): 	"Main propulsion is via the 645-N, 317-s bipropellant LVA thruster, four 22-N monopropellant thrusters provide spacecraft steering during main thruster burns, and ten 4-N monopropellant thrusters are used for attitude control. There is also a reaction-wheel attitude control system. Knowledge for attitude control is provided by star tracking cameras, an inertial measurement unit, and six solar sensors. Power is provided by the solar panels, which extend beyond the sunshade and are rotatable to balance panel temperature and power generation, which provides a nominal 450 W in Mercury orbit. The panels are 70% optical solar reflectors and 30% GaAs/Ge cells. The power is stored in a common-pressure-vessel nickel-hydrogen battery, with 11 vessels and 2 cells per vessel."
	4 (CDF_CHAR/622): 	"Communications are in X-band with downlink through two fixed phased-array antenna clusters and uplink and downlink through medium- and low-gain antennas on the forward and aft sides of the spacecraft. Passive thermal control, primarily a fixed opaque ceramic cloth sunshade, is utilized to maintain operating temperatures near the Sun. Radiators are built into the structure and the orbit is optimized to minimize infrared and visible light heating of the spacecraft from the surface of Mercury. Multilayer insulation, low conductivity couplings, and heaters are also used to maintain temperatures within operating limits."
	5 (CDF_CHAR/512): 	"Five science instruments are mounted externally on the bottom deck of the main body: the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS), Gamma-Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRNS), X-ray Spectrometer (XRS), Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA), and Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer (MASCS). The Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) is mounted on the side and top deck and the magnetometer (MAG) is at the end of the 3.6 m boom. Radio Science (RS) experiments will use the existing communications system."
	6 (CDF_CHAR/725): 	"The Messenger MAG instrument is a miniature three-axis ring-core fluxgate magnetometer with low-noise electronics. It is mounted on a 3.6 m boom in the anti-sunward direction. The MAG has .. 1530 and ..51300 nT ranges with 20-bit internal resolution and 17-bit output resolution. The MAG probe samples magnetic field values along the X, Y, and Z axes at a rate of up to 20 samples/second (commandable and can vary). This dataset has 3-axis calibrated samples of the magnetic field in heliospheric RTN coordinates in units of nano-Tesla, Br, Bt, Bn. The spacecraft position is identified by radial distance from the Sun, latitude above the ecliptic plane, and azimuth with respect to the Earth-Sun line in the ecliptic plane. "

Definition 0 Sensor stowed - prior to boom deployment 1 Boom deployed - SC +Y axis to Sun - sensor in sunlight 2 Boom deployed - SC -Y axis to Sun - sensor in shadowH: Heater Mode Definition 0 Hardware regulation (MAG FSW V8) 1 Software regulation version 1 (MAG FSW V9) 2 Software regulation version 2 (MAG FSW V10)C: Contamination Definition 0 No contamination signals known to be present 1 Uncorrectable contamination signals present 2 Contamination signals present but correctable 3 Contamination signals corrected"

The offsets in the X and Z sensor axes are periodically reevaluated from spacecraft rolls aboutthe vehicle\'s Y-axis. To determine the offset of the Y sensor axis rolls about the spacecraft X-axis must be executed. Such maneuvers are considered higher risk to spacecraft health and have been executed only once during the cruise phase. Taking advantage of the Alfvenic character of solar wind fluctuations, offsets in all three axes are also assessed by solving for the offsets that minimize B dot delta B. The most reliable offset determinations are used to derive a continuous time series for the instrument offsets.Revisions to the offset will be reflected in updated CDRs with an incremental revision number."
