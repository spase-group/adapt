          "description": "Data are derived from the FAST Time-of-flight Energy Angle Mass Spectrograph, TEAMS, Instrument that determines 3-Dimensional Distribution Functions of individual Ion Species over the Energy Range 1 eV to 12000 eV, within 2.5 s (one-half Spacecraft Spin). The Instrument consists of a toroidal Top-Hat Electrostatic Analyzer with instantaneous Acceptance of Ions over 360Â° in Polar Angle in 16 Sectors. Ions passing through the Electrostatic Analyzer are postaccelerated by up to 25 kV and then analyzed for Mass per Charge in a foil-based Time-of-Flight Analyzer. The Data used to construct CDF Data Products are derived from the Survey Data. Survey Data consists of four Mass Groups by 48 Energies by 64 Solid Angle Segments. The four Mass Groups are Hydrogen, H+, Oxygen, O+, singly-charged Helium, He+, and doubly-charged Helium, He++. Only the 16 Equatorial Angle Segments are used for the CDF Data Set. Each Equatorial Solid Angle Segment contains two (four) Samples at each Energy in the 32 (64) Sweep/Spin Mode. The full Angular Range is covered in Half of a Spin but the actual Time Resolution of the Survey Data Product depends upon the Telemetry Mode. In the highest Telemetry Mode Rate, Modes H+ and O+ Survey Data are read out every Half Spin. In the lowest Telemetry Mode Rate Mode, these Data are accumulated for four Spins. The minimum Accumulation Time included in the CDF is one Spin, so if the actual Accumulation Time is a Half Spin, two Data Points are averaged. Otherwise, the Full Resolution is included. In every Mode, He+ and He++ are accumulated twice as long as H+ and O+. To force the H+, O+, and He+ to have an equal Number of Data Points when H+ and O+ have twice the Time Resolution, each He+ Data Point is written twice consecutively in the File.",
