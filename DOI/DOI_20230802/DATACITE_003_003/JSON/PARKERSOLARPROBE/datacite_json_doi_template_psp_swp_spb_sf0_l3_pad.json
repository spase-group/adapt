Instrument team Science Operations Centers, SOCs, and/or Virtual Observatories, VOs, should facilitate this process serving as the contact point between PI and users in most cases. * 2) Users should heed the caveats of investigators to the interpretations and limitations of data or model results. Investigators supplying data or models may insist that such caveats be published. Data and model version numbers should also be specified. * 3) Browse products, Quicklook, and Planning data are not intended for science analysis or publication and should not be used for those purposes without consent of the PI. * 4) Users should acknowledge the sources of data used in all publications, presentations, and reports: &quot;We acknowledge the NASA Parker Solar Probe Mission and the SWEAP team led by J. Kasper for use of data.&quot;. * 5) Users are encouraged to provide the PI a copy of each manuscript that uses the PI data prior to submission of that manuscript for consideration of publication. On publication, the citation should be transmitted to the PI and any other providers of data.",
