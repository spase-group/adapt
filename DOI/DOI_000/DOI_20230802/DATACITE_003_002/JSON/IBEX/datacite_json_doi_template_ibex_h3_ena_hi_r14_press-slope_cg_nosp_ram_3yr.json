          "description": "The Interstellar Boundary Explorer, IBEX, has operated in space since 2008 updating our knowledge of the outer heliosphere and its interaction with the local interstellar medium. Start-time: 2008-12-25. There are currently 15 releases of IBEX-HI and/or IBEX-LO data covering the years from 2009 to 2018. This data set is derived from the Release 14 three-year IBEX-Hi map data with two-year overlaps of adjacent maps, 2009-2011, 2010-2012, and so forth through 2015-2017 from ram-direction fluxes with corrections for spacecraft motion, cg: Compton-Getting, but with no corrections, sp, for Energetic Neutral Atom, ENA, survival probability between 1 and 100 AU. The data set parameters include line-of-sight, LOS, integrated pressures computed separately from the Global Distributed Flux, GDF, the Ribbon Flux, and the Total Flux from summing GDF and Ribbon LOS pressures. Additionally there are signal to noise ratios for the GDF, Ribbon, and Total LOS pressures. Finally, there are power law slope values for the GDF differential flux and signal to noise ratios of the slope. The IBEX Release 14 data are archived as fully citable data. Please consult IBEX team publications and personnel for further details on production, processing, and usage of these data. The data consist of ram-direction sky maps in Solar Ecliptic Longitude, east and west, and Latitude angles for the above parameters. Details of the data and enabled science from Release 14 are given in the following journal publication: Schwadron, N. A., et al. 2018, Time Dependence of the IBEX Ribbon and the Globally Distributed Energetic Neutral Atom Flux Using the First 9 Years of Observations, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/aae48e. The following codes are used to define data set types in the multiple IBEX data releases: +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Code Code definition --------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- cg Compton-Getting corrections have been applied to the data to account for the speed of the spacecraft relative to the direction of arrival of the ENAs nocg no Compton-Getting corrections --------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- sp survival probability corrections have been applied to the data to account for the loss of ENAs due to radiation pressure, photoionization and ionization via charge exchange with solar wind protons as they stream through the heliosphere. This correction scales the data out from IBEX at 1 AU to approximately 100 AU. In the original data this mode is denoted as Tabular. noSP no survival probability corrections have been applied to the data --------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- omni data from all directions ram data was collected when the spacecraft was ramming into the incoming ENAs antiram data was collected when the spacecraft was moving away from the incoming ENAs +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ This particular data set denoted in the original ASCII files as: +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Directory Name File Content Description +---------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ GDFPressure Globally Distributed Flux Line-of-Sight Integrated Pressure in pdyne-au/cm^2 GDFSlope Power Law Slope of the differential flux spectrum for the Globally Distributed Flux GDFSlopeSN Signal/Noise ratio of the GDF differential flux power law slope where noise represents uncertainty GDFSN Globally Distributed Flux Signal/Noise, where Noise is defined as the uncertainty and the Signal is GDF Line-of-Sight integrated pressure RibbonPressure Ribbon Line-of-Sight Integrated Pressure in pdyne-au/cm^2 RibbonSN Ribbon Signal/Noise, where Noise is defined as the uncertainty and the Signal is GDF Line-of-Sight integrated pressure TotPressure Total Pressure in ENA maps including both the GDF and Ribbon.
