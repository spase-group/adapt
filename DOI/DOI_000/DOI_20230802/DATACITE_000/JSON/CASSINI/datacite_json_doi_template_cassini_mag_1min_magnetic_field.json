          "description": "Cassini Magnetic Field 1 min Averages for the Year 2020 in RTN Coordinates. RTN Coordinates consist of the Radial Component, R, from the Sun to the Spacecraft), the Tangential Component, T, parallel to the Solar Equatorial Plane and perpendicular to R, and the Normal Component, N, that completes Right-Handed Set. This File contains a Subset of all of the Cassini MAG Data for 2001 consisting of only the Data after the Day of the last Jupiter Bowshock Crossing, 2001-01-15. The Data are mostly from the Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM). The Table at vhm.txt identifies the 52 Days in 2000 to 2004 for which the Data are solely from the Vector Helium Magnetometer (VHM). Days not in the Table contain only FGM Data. VHM_mode Variable indicates (value 1) whether Data are from VHM. This File was produced from raw, L1A, Data at the PDS/PPI node using Software provided by the Cassini MAG Team, and employing the latest Calibration available. The PDS/PPI Node produced both 1 s vectors and 1 min averages. The MAG team reports that while Range 0 data are well calibrated for both the Fluxgate Magnetometer, FGM and the Vector Helium Magnetometer, VHM, the higher Range Data need Improvement, See the RANGE_CHANGES.ASC Document for a Time History of Range Changes. These Data will be replaced as the Calibration is improved. The FGM_mode Variable indicates (Value 0) if Data is Range 0. See https://www.igpp.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/ditdos?volume=COMAG_0XXX&amp;folder=DOCUMENT/DATA_QUALITY&amp;file=RANGE_CHANGES for Details. In particular, this Documentation reports that FGM was in Range=0 for the following extended Intervals plus other brief Intervals, YYYY/DDD/HH, inclusive: 1999/230/05 to 1999/245/07, 1999/245/09 to 2000/037/12, 2000/039/00 to 2000/053/18, 2000/053/20 to 2000/056/01, 2000/057/23 to 2002/334/13, 2002/334/17 to 2003/292/18, 2003/292/22 to 2004/046/11, 2004/046/15 to 2004/088/08, 2004/088/12 to 2004/136/06, 2004/136/11 to 2004/174/01, 2004/174/06 to 2004/182/17",
