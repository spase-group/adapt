          "description": "particle-flux&gt;Merged proton, electron and alpha particle fluxes. Helios-A and Helios-B Spacecraft were a Pair of Deep Space Probes developed by the Federal Republic of Germany, FRG, in a Cooperative Program with NASA. The Purpose of the Mission was to make pioneering Measurements of the Interplanetary Medium from the Vicinity of the Earth Orbit to 0.3 AU. The Objective of Experiment, E6, was to study High-Energy, Charged, Cosmic Ray Particles of Solar, Planetary, and Galactic Origin in Interplanetary Space. Protons and Alpha Particles with Energies &amp;gt;1.3 MeV/n, and electrons &amp;gt;3.3 MeV were measured within Interplanetary Space over the Range from 0.3 to 1.0 A.U. The Instrument, a Particle Telescope with 55$#176; Field of View, consisted of five Semiconductor Detectors, one Sapphire Cherenkov Counter, and one Scintillation Counter, all enclosed by an Anticoincidence Cylinder. The Telescope was calibrated prior to Launch using Radioactive Sources, Particle Acceletors, and Ground-Level Muons. It measured Protons and Alpha particles in six Channels, 1.3 to 3.3, 3.3 to 13, 13 to 27, 27 to 37, 37 to 45, and &amp;gt;45 MeV/n, and Electrons in five Energy Channels, 0.3 to 0.8, 0.8 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and &amp;gt;4 MeV. For more Detail See pages 253-257 of Raumfahrtforschung, Volume 19, Number 5, 1975. The Helios-A Cosmic Ray &amp;apos;.dat&amp;apos; and Helios-B Cosmic Ray &amp;apos;.dat&amp;apos; files contains hourly averaged Fluxes of Electrons, Protons and Alpha Particles in the MeV Ranges. The Files were written in ASCII-Codes. Each Record contains 10 hourly Averages. The Differential Fluxes, (m^2 s sr MeV)^-1, Cover, in several Bands, the Energy Range 0.3 to 2.0 MeV for Electrons, 4.0 to 51 MeV for Protons, and 2.0 to 48 MeV for Alpha Particles. Also provided are the Integral Fluxes of Alphas above 48 MeV, and Protons above 51 MeV. For some of the Energy Channels, the Standard Deviations of the Averages are also provided. Each File is preceded by a Header Record, providing the Start and Stop Times of the Data in the File. The Acronyms for the Rate Channels are composed of a Letter and an Indication of the Energy Range in MeV/n for Protons and Alpha Particles, respectively and MeV for Electrons. The counting Rates are given as (m^2 s sr MeV/n)^-1 except for the Integral Channels P&amp;gt;51 and A&amp;gt;48, which are given as (m^2 s sr)^-1. Note: 1. Negative Rates, -0.99999E+04, indicate Missing or Invalid Data. 2. The Energy Boundaries for the Electron Channels 0.2 to 0.8 and 0.8 to 2 are only rough Estimates.",
